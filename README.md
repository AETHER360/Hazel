# Hazel
Hazel game engine developed following The Cherno Game Engine Series. This is not my own work. All credit belongs to Yan Chernikov and his Hazel Game Engine Series. 

I decided to follow this tutorial as I have learned alot from his Java/C++ lessons on YouTube, and wanted to learn how a Game Engine works behind the scenes.
